        <p class="lead mb-4">At the age of 5 my dad would take my sister and I to the golf course to hit golf balls for fun. I started to actually like the game so my dad got me a coach at the age of 7 and that's when I started to love the game. I played in many tournaments and I never was able to win. I started to give up and put myself down because no matter how much I practiced I wasn't able to win. I practice 2-3 hours almost every day. I grew up in Covina, but my dad decided to put me in the Walnut district because of the education and the golf team. I started winning matches and tournaments those years and it gave me hope. It made me realize what I wanted to be in the future, which was to become a professional golfer. I started practicing more and harder because my family did have enough money for me to go to college. I was lucky enough to be chosen to go to Guatemala with my teammates and play people from Puerto Rico, Mexico and Colombia. This was the first time I went in a plane and that‚Äôs when I realized I love traveling. During my high school years, I was able to become freshman of the year, most improved, MVP of the year and hall of fame.  I was very thankful and lucky that I was able to get a scholarship at a D1 college. I played for University of California, Riverside. Playing at a collegiate level was not any easier. The practice was harder and the workouts killed me. My teammates were like a second family. We did everything together, whether it was going out to eat and get boba, or losing a tournament, or winning a tournament. We had lots of road trips that I will cherish forever. What I found so cool playing other teams was that everyone was that many players were from all over the world. My team and I were able to win the Big West Championship two years in a row but we weren‚Äôt able to secure the win to become NCAA champions. During these 4 years playing college golf I was able to make lifetime friends and so many new friends. I was able to travel to many different states and enjoy different foods. I have made so many memories in college that I will cherish forever. After college I started playing cactus tour tournaments so I can try to get to play amateur tournaments. After playing the tournament so many times I was able to get in an amateur tournament. I was able to win my first amateur tournament and I was able to get my pro card. At that moment my life changed forever. I started getting more sponsors and I was lucky enough for Nike to sponsor me. I cried because Nike is a brand that I dreamed of being sponsored by. I started traveling the world and that‚Äôs when I became content with my life. <br><br>
